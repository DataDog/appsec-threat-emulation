# Credential Stuffing

## Overview
Credential Stuffing attacks are a very popular attack against authentication systems. The threat actors attempts to gain unauthorized access to accounts by using lists of compromised credentials.

## Run the attack
You can run the attacks using our cli tool

```shell
docker run --rm -t --network asm-threat-emulation-network asm/threat-cli run -a 7
```

This command will run the cli inside the docker container. The CLI will launch attacks from this [file](./../cli/attacks/generic-payloads.txt) on the vulnerable application.

```shell
Running attack #7:  Credential Stuffing attack
Target URL:  http://juiceshop:3000
âœ” Credential Stuffing attack - done
```

## Result
